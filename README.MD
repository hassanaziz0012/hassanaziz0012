# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hassan, a software developer. I work with Python, Go, and TypeScript. Currently, working on learning C, Rust, AI, and other stuff. 

## Technologies I know:
* **Python (pandas/numpy for data science, Django for web, and a ton of other niche libraries/frameworks)**
* **TypeScript**
* **AWS Cloud Services**
* **Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)**
* **Managing Servers (very comfortable with Linux environments)**
* **Caching, Message Brokers, and Load Balancers (have had to configure these things for some large-scale projects serving 10k+ users)**
* **Discord Bots**

Also, I freelance and am always looking for work, so if you have a project you'd like me on, you can reach me at:
